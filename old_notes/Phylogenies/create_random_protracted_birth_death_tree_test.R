  # - the first column is the incipient-level label of a species 
  # - the second column is the incipient-level label of the parent of the species 
  # - the third column is the time at which a species is born as incipient species
  # - the fourth column is the time of speciation-completion of the species 
  # If the fourth element equals -1, then the species is still incipient. - the fifth column is the time of extinction of the species 
  # If the fifth element equals -1, then the species is still extant. - The sixth column is the species-level label of the species 
  # sL is a matrix like L but for stree 
  # igtree.extinct is the tree in simmap format with incipient and good flags and including extinct species 
  # igtree.extant is the tree in simmap format with incipient and good flags without extinct species 
  # recontree is the reconstructed tree in phylo format, reconstructed using the approximation in Lambert et al. 2014 
  # reconL is the matrix corresponding to recontree 
  # L0 is a matrix where the crown age is at 0; for internal use only
